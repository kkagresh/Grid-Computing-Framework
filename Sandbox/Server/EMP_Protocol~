IPC happens through the shared memory concept. GCF writes to a file "tasks_done.emp" telling which all tasks have been done. EMP needs to read this and write data to "emp_response.emp". GCF suspends any further task execution until data is read from that file.

Commands:
CONTINUE
STOPALL
STOP task
SUSPENDALL
SUSPEND task
RESUMEALL
RESUME task
