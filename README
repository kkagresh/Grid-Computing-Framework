This is the Git Repository for the Grid Computing Framework.

Goals of this framework are to provide an

	* easy to use,
	* easy to deploy, and
	* easy to maintain moderate sized grid.

Currently the following features are left before a stable version is released:

1. Implementing the Load Balancing Algorithm, currently the Genetic Simulated Annealing (GSA) algorithm is the most suitable candidate.

2. Completing the Fault-Tolerance features.

3. Interfacing with the GUI (ready, but to be linked).

4. Completing the Execution Monitor Program.


GCF is expected to be completed by 24th April, 2009.
